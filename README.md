# Stock Price Forecasting Application

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the next day's closing stock prices using an LSTM model. It tracks 86 stocks, provides historical data visualization, and forecasts future prices. The app allows users to select, search, and add stocks, while dynamically generating charts to display both historical and forecasted prices.

## Features

- **Stock Selection**: Choose from a list of pre-loaded stocks to view their historical data and forecasts.
- **Add New Stocks**: Search for additional stocks and add them to the tracking system.
